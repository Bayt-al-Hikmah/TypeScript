# 🚀 Introduction to TypeScript and Node.js

Welcome to the official repository for the complete "Introduction to TypeScript and Node.js" course. This repository contains all the course materials, code samples, and exercises.

This course is designed to take you from the fundamentals of how computers work to building modern, robust applications using TypeScript and Node.js, including asynchronous programming and object-oriented principles.

---

## 📚 Course Outline

This course is divided into 5 main lectures, each building on the last.

### Lecture 1: Foundations
* Learn About How Computers Work
* Introduction to Programming Languages
* Introduction to TypeScript and Node.js
* TypeScript Basics (Types, Variables, etc.)
* User Input and Output

### Lecture 2: Control Flow
* Using Comparison and Logical Operators
* Writing Conditional Statements (`if`/`else`, `switch`)
* Working with Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)

### Lecture 3: Building Blocks
* Working with Functions (Declaration, Expressions, Arrow Functions)
* Working with Modules (Import/Export)
* Understanding Packages & Namespaces

### Lecture 4: Robust Programming
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in TypeScript (Classes, Interfaces, Inheritance)
* Error Handling in TypeScript (`try`/Tcatch`, Custom Errors)

### Lecture 5: Advanced Concepts
* Working with Generics
* Learning more about Advanced TypeScript Concepts (Utility Types, Decorators)
* Asynchronous TypeScript (`async`/`await`, Promises)

## 💻 Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, you'll need to have Node.js and TypeScript installed on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended).
* **TypeScript:** Install globally via npm (Node Package Manager).
    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
* **TS-Node:** A handy tool to run TypeScript files directly.
    ```bash
    npm install -g ts-node
    ```

### Running the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bayt-al-Hikmah/TypeScript
    ```

2.  **Navigate to a lecture directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Lecture1
    ```

3.  **Run a specific file:**
    ```bash
    ts-node example-file.ts
    ```
